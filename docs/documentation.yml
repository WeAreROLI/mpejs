      "[MPE](#MPE) (Multidimensional Polyphonic Expression) is a widely adopted
      iteration upon MIDI 1.0.\n\n

      By assigning conventional note on/off messages into individual “note
      channels”, the [MPE proposed standard](#MPE) enables continuous control
      parameters to be attached to each individual active note. These parameters
      can be used to represent, for example, per-note pitch bend, pressure and
      timbre changes.\n\n

      The working group is supported by, among others, ROLI, Apple, Bitwig,
      Moog, Haken and Roger Linn Design. It is currently implemented in ROLI's
      Equator and NOISE software synthesizers, as well as Logic X, Bitwig Studio
      and Cubase.\n\n

      The included [`mpeInstrument`](#mpeInstrument) module provides a state
      container which handles incoming MIDI messages via the
      [`processMidiMessage`](#mpeInstrument#processMidiMessage) method and
      maintains the instrument state internally. Current playing notes can be
      accessed via the [`activeNotes`](#mpeInstrument#activeNotes) method. A
      [`subscribe`](#mpeInstrument#subscribe) method is also provided, allowing
      change listeners to be registered."
