      "[MPE](#MPE) (Multidimensional Polyphonic Expression) is a widely adopted
      iteration upon MIDI 1.0.\n\n

      By assigning conventional note on/off messages into “note channels”, the
      [MPE proposed
      standard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vpjxoPHw82X3xyNvE6_hsDeL86vloNQZC83NHD8edow/edit)
      enables continuous control parameters to be attached to individual active
      notes. These parameters can be used to represent continuously changing
      per-note pitch bend, pressure and timbre.\n\n

      The working group is supported by ROLI, Apple, Bitwig, Moog, Haken and
      Roger Linn Design. It is currently implemented in ROLI’s Equator and NOISE
      software synthesizers, as well as Logic X, Bitwig Studio and Cubase.\n\n

      A C++ implementation is also available, included in
      [JUCE](https://juce.com)."

      "To install the latest version of mpe.js:  \n
      `npm install --save mpe`\n\n

      It is recommended to use mpe.js via [ES2015’s module
      system](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/import)
      (via [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v6+)
      or as a CommonJS module (for ES5 users using
      [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) or
      [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)).\n\n

      If you don’t use a module bundler, that’s also fine. The `lib` folder of
      the mpe.js node package also includes a version of the library that can be
      used directly as a `<script>` tag. Both `mpe.js` and `mpe.min.js` can be
      used in this way, and will assign the library contents to the global
      variable `mpe`."
